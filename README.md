# Social Influence Modeling in Networks

## ---- Estimating and Embedding Heavy-Tailed Networks

The topic of this project is the 3rd one **Tail & Network**. 

I first proposed a method to estimate the scale parameters in the heavy-tail distributed network.

Then give several models to embed influence factors.
$$
v_i^Tv_j \approx w_{i, j} = \sum_{p_k\in P_{ij}} \tau ^{len(p_k)}
